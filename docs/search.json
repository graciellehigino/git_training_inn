Generally, you need to have at least the “repo” permissions toggled ON for the token to provide read/write access to the repositories you typically have access to. NOTE: the Personal Access Token is only available for copying until you close the page. Once you close the page, GitHub will not show you that token again and you’ll have to generate a new token if you forget/lose it.\nFollow those instructions, then do the following on all machines you use git on. This command will configure git to look at your ~/.git-credentials file for your GitHub credentials.\n\ngit config --global credential.helper 'store'\n\nThen open/create ~/.git-credentials with nano and add the following line, where &lt;GITHUB_USERNAME&gt; is your GitHub username and &lt;PASTE_TOKEN_HERE&gt; is the Token you copied from the GitHub page.\n\nhttps://&lt;GITHUB_USERNAME&gt;:&lt;PASTE_TOKEN_HERE&gt;@github.com\n\nSave the file and you should be able to do all of your command-line git operations as usual (and without entering your username and password every time).\nPlease keep in mind that this is effectively a password to your account (although only for whatever you grant it the authority to do), so treat it like you’d treat any of your other passwords (don’t paste it into Slack, email, etc.)\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "By completing this training, you are automatically subscribed to the 100 Days of Version Control Challenge! 🎉\n\nPurpose\nThe purpose of this challenge is to encourage you to create the habit of committing and pushing often, and to lose the fear of version control. It is also aimed at practicing and implementing best practices related to version control, such as descriptive commit messages, rules for branching, grouping commits per push, etc.\n\n\nOutcome\nAt the end of the 100 days, you will have a history of contributions that is registered on GitHub (that you can use as a portfolio!). We hope that the multiple milestones and cellebrations, and also the record of everything that you do during these 100 days will empower you to keep the habit throughout your career.\n\n\nProcess\nYou will work in teams of three on a shared project. You can, potentially, work on more than one project as long as you collaborate on them during the 100 days.\nYou will need to make contributions in the form of commits and push, PRs, or merges every day, for 100 days.\nFor each challenge, you or your group will need to submit your nominations using the designated form to be provided by the organization on this page at a future date.\nYou will also have access to office hours every Monday at 10am PT to debug and ask questions, and you can chose to be mentored by one of the instructors during these hours.\n\nMilestones\nEvery 30 days will mark a milestone, and a “newsletter” will be sent to all participants with highlights of the month, featuring achievements, anonymized bugs and solutions to these bugs, and what to expect for the next 30 days (reminder of the challenges).\nAt the end of the 100 days + one week (March 13, 2026), there will be a big celebration with distribution of prizes.\nDetails about online calls and graduation party will be announced here and on the monthly newsletter.\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
